# --- Feature Flags ---
# This flag bypasses the check that the endpoint to fetch data for the printing of PDFs `getByIdForPrinter`, is only accessible from the server.
# Useful for when you want to debug the /printer/{resumeId} route to quickly take a peek at the page that is sent to the printer.

# This flag disables new signups, both on the web app and the server.
FLAG_DISABLE_SIGNUPS="false"

# This flag disables email/password login. Disables email verification, forgot password, and reset password flows. Users can still sign up via social auth (Google/GitHub/Custom OAuth), unless FLAG_DISABLE_SIGNUPS is also set to true.
FLAG_DISABLE_EMAIL_AUTH="false"

# This flag disables the image processing.
# This is useful if you are using a machine with limited resources, like a Raspberry Pi.

# --- Others ---
# Google Cloud API Key (optional)
# This is not used within Reactive Resume, but in src/scripts/fonts/generate.ts to generate a list of fonts served by Google Fonts.
